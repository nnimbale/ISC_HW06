### Q1

 What does your commit history look like now? What branches do you have,
and what commits are they pointing to? Where does HEAD point?

I have three commits and one branche i.e., main:
1. the initial commit to initialize R files. 
2. Commit to change in llr and test_llr files.
3. Commit to update benchmark_llr.

Head points to main.

### Q2

What changed when you checked out speed-test-1? Where does HEAD point
now? If you make changes and commit them, where will the master and speed-test-1
branches point?

I got into a new branch, having the same set of files from main branch. The master/main will be pointing previous commit and head will be pointing to speed-test-1.


### Q3

The apply function multiplies each column ofùëã by the weight vector Wz element-wise, without the need to construct a full diagonal matrix.

### Q4

Question 3: Which version of the function is faster?

The speed-test-1 version is fasted than the previous one.

### Q5

Question 4: What function did you use? Why is it equivalent to the matrix multiplication?
